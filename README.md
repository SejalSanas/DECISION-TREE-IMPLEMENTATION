##DESCRIPTION OF DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION TASK : - 
*Tools and Libraries Used-
Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle the dataset.
NumPy: A library for numerical computations, used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for model training, evaluation, and metrics.
load_iris: A function to load the Iris dataset.
DecisionTreeClassifier: The machine learning model used for classification.
train_test_split: A function to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
export_text: A function to export the decision tree rules in a textual format.
plot_tree: A function to visualize the decision tree.
Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing data.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
*Editor/Platform Used-
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment that allows for the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is particularly useful for data analysis and visualization tasks.
*Task Applicability-
Classification Problems: Decision Trees can be applied to various classification problems in different domains, such as healthcare (disease diagnosis), finance (credit scoring), and marketing (customer segmentation).
Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding which features contribute most to the predictions can help in feature selection and improving model performance.
Decision Support Systems: Decision Trees can be used in systems that require clear decision-making processes, such as loan approval systems or medical diagnosis tools.
Data Exploration: The visual nature of Decision Trees makes them useful for exploratory data analysis, allowing stakeholders to understand the decision-making process of the model.
